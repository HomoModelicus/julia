# Tenedyn - Text node dynamics

- This is a Simulink-like signal flow based simulation tool.
- The aim is to create a model based on ordinary differential equations (ode), by means of primitive elements, like Sum() or Sin() or Integrator().
- The integrators define the state variables in the system, up to this point no algebraic loop is allowed, so differential-algebraic equations are not permitted yet.
- For later stages submodels/compounds are planned in order to make composite objects

In what follows I'll show you a small working example.
