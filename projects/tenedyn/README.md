# Tenedyn - Text node dynamics

This is a Simulink-like signal flow based simulation tool.
The aim is to create a model based on ordinary differential equations (ode), by means of primitive elements, like Sum() or Sin() or Integrator().
The integrators define the state variables in the system, up to this point no algebraic loop is allowed, so differential-algebraic equations are not permitted yet.
